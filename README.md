Consider running "python3 basic_ui.py"
Then:
- jump on 'space'
- exit on 'esc'
- restart on 'r'
- pause/unpause on any other button

Red text meaning:
(vertical position, vertical_speed, next_pipe_low, next_pipe_high, next_pipe_distance)
(points, is_game_not_lost_yet)

There are finitely many pipes

All settings can be changed in config files

Enjoy!
